Hello {ARGS}!

I understand there may be some confusion regarding chatting with individuals with a "BOT" tag. Let me clarify: these individuals are not bots! They are real people utilizing a tool called PluralKit to help them communicate.

Users who use this tool may have Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)/Other Specified Dissociative Disorder (OSDD).  DID is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states (often referred to as "alters").  DID can develop as a coping mechanism for severe or ongoing trauma.  It's important to approach these interactions with respect, as DID is often a chronic condition.

If you'd like to learn more, please refer to this thread <#876856211746746388>, or respectfully engage with other systems (if they are comfortable discussing it).  Please be mindful and avoid pressuring anyone for information.

Best regards, <:psi_salute:860198394714652722>
