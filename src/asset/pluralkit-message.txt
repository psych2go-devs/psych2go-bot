Hey{ARGS}!

I notice that you're confused about chatting with a "BOT", so let me help you shed some light on this. Unlike me, **they aren't bots!** They're real people using a tool, PluralKit, to help them communicate.

The people who use this bot have a condition called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), in which the person has two or more personalities (shortened to "alters"). Many people with DID have experienced severe trauma, and in order to help them cope with the stress they've endured (and some who continue to endure), they use their alters to communicate. This is often sadly a chronic disorder, so please try to stay respectful! 

And if you want to know more about the disorder, feel free to head to a thread that Alley created or you can ask her or any of the other systems about it (if they feel comfortable answering, please don't pressure them!) Be respectful. :) 

Farewell! <:psi_salute:860198394714652722>
